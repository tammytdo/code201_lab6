A cookie sales calculator for the trendy new coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. This program predicts the number of cookies each location must make every day so that it can manage its supplies inventory and baking schedule. The number of cookies are calculated with consideration for the hours of operation and a few factors unique to each location:  

The minimum number of customers per hour.  
The maximum number of customers per hour.  
The average number of cookies purchased per customer.  

This adaptable program allows admins to add and remove locations from the daily projections report, and modify the input numbers for each location based on day of the week, special events, and other factors.
